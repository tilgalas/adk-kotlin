/**
 * Example Space Commander agent demonstrating the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow using the
 * Kotlin ADK.
 *
 * This example showcases how to declare a `@Tool`-annotated function with `requireConfirmation =
 * true` so that the framework pauses agent execution and requests human confirmation before
 * executing a potentially destructive or high-risk tool (here, `initiateWarpJump`).
 *
 * The agent is configured to use the Gemini API for inference, behaving like a ship's computer
 * equipped with the tools defined in [ShipComputerTools].
 *
 * ## How it works
 * 1. The agent is configured with the tools generated from [ShipComputerTools]: `scanPlanet` (safe)
 *    and `initiateWarpJump` (risky, gated by `requireConfirmation = true`).
 * 2. When the LLM decides to jump, the generated wrapper for `initiateWarpJump` records a
 *    confirmation request via [com.google.adk.kt.tools.ToolContext.requestConfirmation] and returns
 *    a placeholder error response.
 * 3. The execution loop pauses, waiting for the user to provide a
 *    [com.google.adk.kt.events.ToolConfirmation].
 * 4. Once the confirmation is injected via a `FunctionResponse` for the synthetic
 *    `adk_request_confirmation` call, the flow resumes and executes the tool.
 *
 * The example can be exercised interactively with [com.google.adk.kt.runners.ReplRunner], which
 * prompts the operator for a yes/no decision whenever a tool gated by `requireConfirmation = true`
 * is about to run.
