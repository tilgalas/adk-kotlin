/**
 * Represents an LLM-backed agentic application.
 *
 * An [App] is the top-level container for an agentic system powered by LLMs. It bundles an
 * application name together with the [rootAgent] that serves as the root of the agent tree,
 * enabling coordination and communication across all agents in the hierarchy.
 *
 * [appName] must be a valid identifier (letters, digits, and underscores only, not starting with a
 * digit) and must not be the reserved value `"user"`, which is reserved for end-user input.
 * Construction throws [IllegalArgumentException] if [appName] does not meet these requirements.
 *
 * @property appName The application name.
 * @property rootAgent The root agent of the application's agent tree.
