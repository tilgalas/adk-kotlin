/**
 * Represents the actions attached to an event.
 *
 * @property skipSummarization If true, it won't call the model to summarize the function response.
 *   Only used for a function response event.
 * @property stateDelta Indicates that the event is updating the state with the given delta.
 * @property artifactDelta Indicates that the event is updating an artifact. The key is the
 *   filename, and the value is the version.
 * @property transferToAgent If set, the event transfers to the specified agent.
 * @property escalate The agent is escalating to a higher level agent.
 * @property endOfAgent If true, the current agent has finished its current run. Note that there can
 *   be multiple events with [endOfAgent] set to `true` for the same agent within one invocation
 *   when there is a loop. This should only be set by the ADK workflow.
 * @property requestedToolConfirmations A map of tool confirmations requested by this event, keyed
 *   by function call ID.
 * @property rewindBeforeInvocationId If set, the agent will rewind history before the specified
 *   invocation ID.
 * @property agentState The state of the agent for resumability.
 * @property compaction If set, this event carries a context-compaction summary that replaces the
 *   compacted range of events when the next LLM prompt is built. See [EventCompaction].
